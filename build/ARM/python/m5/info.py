README_md = "# The gem5 Simulator\n\nThis is the repository for the gem5 simulator. It contains the full source code\nfor the simulator and all tests and regressions.\n\nThe gem5 simulator is a modular platform for computer-system architecture\nresearch, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor\nmicroarchitecture. It is primarily used to evaluate new hardware designs,\nsystem software changes, and compile-time and run-time system optimizations.\n\nThe main website can be found at <http://www.gem5.org>.\n\n## Testing status\n\n**Note**: These regard tests run on the develop branch of gem5:\n<https://github.com/gem5/gem5/tree/develop>.\n\n[![Daily Tests](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/actions/workflows/daily-tests.yaml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/actions/workflows/daily-tests.yaml)\n[![Weekly Tests](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/actions/workflows/weekly-tests.yaml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/actions/workflows/weekly-tests.yaml)\n[![Compiler Tests](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/actions/workflows/compiler-tests.yaml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/gem5/gem5/actions/workflows/compiler-tests.yaml)\n\n## Getting started\n\nA good starting point is <http://www.gem5.org/about>, and for\nmore information about building the simulator and getting started\nplease see <http://www.gem5.org/documentation> and\n<http://www.gem5.org/documentation/learning_gem5/introduction>.\n\n## Building gem5\n\nTo build gem5, you will need the following software: g++ or clang,\nPython (gem5 links in the Python interpreter), SCons, zlib, m4, and lastly\nprotobuf if you want trace capture and playback support. Please see\n<http://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building> for more details\nconcerning the minimum versions of these tools.\n\nOnce you have all dependencies resolved, execute\n`scons build/ALL/gem5.opt` to build an optimized version of the gem5 binary\n(`gem5.opt`) containing all gem5 ISAs. If you only wish to compile gem5 to\ninclude a single ISA, you can replace `ALL` with the name of the ISA. Valid\noptions include `ARM`, `NULL`, `MIPS`, `POWER`, `RISCV`, `SPARC`, and `X86`\nThe complete list of options can be found in the build_opts directory.\n\nSee https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/building for more\ninformation on building gem5.\n\n## The Source Tree\n\nThe main source tree includes these subdirectories:\n\n* build_opts: pre-made default configurations for gem5\n* build_tools: tools used internally by gem5's build process.\n* configs: example simulation configuration scripts\n* ext: less-common external packages needed to build gem5\n* include: include files for use in other programs\n* site_scons: modular components of the build system\n* src: source code of the gem5 simulator. The C++ source, Python wrappers, and Python standard library are found in this directory.\n* system: source for some optional system software for simulated systems\n* tests: regression tests\n* util: useful utility programs and files\n\n## gem5 Resources\n\nTo run full-system simulations, you may need compiled system firmware, kernel\nbinaries and one or more disk images, depending on gem5's configuration and\nwhat type of workload you're trying to run. Many of these resources can be\nobtained from <https://resources.gem5.org>.\n\nMore information on gem5 Resources can be found at\n<https://www.gem5.org/documentation/general_docs/gem5_resources/>.\n\n## Getting Help, Reporting bugs, and Requesting Features\n\nWe provide a variety of channels for users and developers to get help, report\nbugs, requests features, or engage in community discussions. Below\nare a few of the most common we recommend using.\n\n* **GitHub Discussions**: A GitHub Discussions page. This can be used to start\ndiscussions or ask questions. Available at\n<https://github.com/orgs/gem5/discussions>.\n* **GitHub Issues**: A GitHub Issues page for reporting bugs or requesting\nfeatures. Available at <https://github.com/gem5/gem5/issues>.\n* **Jira Issue Tracker**: A Jira Issue Tracker for reporting bugs or requesting\nfeatures. Available at <https://gem5.atlassian.net/>.\n* **Slack**: A Slack server with a variety of channels for the gem5 community\nto engage in a variety of discussions. Please visit\n<https://www.gem5.org/join-slack> to join.\n* **gem5-users@gem5.org**: A mailing list for users of gem5 to ask questions\nor start discussions. To join the mailing list please visit\n<https://www.gem5.org/mailing_lists>.\n* **gem5-dev@gem5.org**: A mailing list for developers of gem5 to ask questions\nor start discussions. To join the mailing list please visit\n<https://www.gem5.org/mailing_lists>.\n\n## Contributing to gem5\n\nWe hope you enjoy using gem5. When appropriate we advise sharing your\ncontributions to the project. <https://www.gem5.org/contributing> can help you\nget started. Additional information can be found in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.\n"
